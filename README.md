Imagine that there are five philosophers sitting around a round table. Between each philosopher, there is a fork. Each philosopher spends most of their time thinking, but occasionally they get hungry and need to eat. To eat, a philosopher needs to pick up the forks on their left and right. However, the forks are shared, and only one philosopher can use them at a time. Therefore, a philosopher needs to pick up both forks to eat and then put them back on the table when they are done.

The problem is that if all philosophers try to pick up the fork on their left simultaneously, they can enter a state of deadlock where no one can eat. Therefore, the task is to create an algorithm that allows the philosophers to share the forks in a way that avoids deadlock and allows all of them to eat.

The technique used to ensure mutual exclusion is the use of synchronized blocks and semaphores around critical operations involving fork manipulation. This ensures that only one philosopher at a time can access and manipulate the forks, avoiding race conditions and ensuring the consistency of the system's state.

The algorithm was developed using Java, with the concepts of threads, OOP, and algorithms and data structures.
